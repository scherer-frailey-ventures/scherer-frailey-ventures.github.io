(e.g., \"5 years running\", \"X ventures supported\", \"Weekly syncs since 2020\", \"X family members collaborating\")\n\n3. **Resources/Next Steps**: Should there be a section suggesting how others can start their own family collaborative? (e.g., \"Getting Started Guide\", \"Download our charter template\", link to the public docs)\n\nThese will help me nail the messaging and structure!",
