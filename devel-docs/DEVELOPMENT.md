# Public Website Development Notes

## Project: scherer-frailey-ventures.github.io

### Design Direction (November 3, 2025)

#### Core Purpose
Showcase how a formalized, extended-family-based collaborative organization can support individual ventures and personal growth. Inspire others to create similar structures within their own families.

#### Target Audience
1. Independent entrepreneurs who miss team environments
2. People interested in team collaboration frameworks (even family-based)
3. Media/storytellers looking for positive family collaboration stories
4. General public curious about strong family structures

#### Design Choices
- **Style**: Modern & tech-forward
- **Layout**: Single-page scrolling
- **Visuals**: Abstract/icon-based (no photos for now)
- **Effects**: Animated sections, hover effects
- **Colors**: Tech-forward palette (current avatar may be replaced)

#### Content Strategy
- **Tone**: Mix of inspirational, practical, and story-driven
- **Key Messaging**: 
  - Collaboration
  - Family
  - Accountability
- **Visual Enhancement**: Unicode pictographic characters throughout
- **Metrics to Highlight**:
  - 5 years running (since 2020)
  - Weekly syncs
  - Monthly demos
  - Number of family members/ventures
